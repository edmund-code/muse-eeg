One of the easiest game one can play with a consumer-grade EEG device like Muse2 is the Dino Run - a game can be played with just single click (default is the space key)

For this to work we only need 4 comonents

1. Code to capture EEG signal from the device
2. Model to classify the EEG signal captured in the previous step
3. Code that allows Python to control keyboard/mouse
4. The game itself
